I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Rutgers University (expected 2026). My research focuses on near-duplicate text alignment and deduplication for large-scale LLM pretraining datasets, vector databases and approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, and sparse attention for efficient LLM inference. Previously, I was a research intern at Alibaba Cloud. I am open to discussions and collaborations, as well as job opportunities in both academia and industry. Feel free to reach out at zhencan.peng@rutgers.edu.
